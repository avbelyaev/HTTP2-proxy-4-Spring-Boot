# HTTP2 proxies for Spring Boot

Testing how proxies

- Traefik
- Nginx
- Zuul

work with Spring Boot deployed on servers

- Tomcat
- Jetty
- Undertow

Also checking how Server Side events work in such configs. `Spoiler: they do not work with Zuul proxy`

For more notes see corresponding repositories. cURL requests reside in `requests` dir.
